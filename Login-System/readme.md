<p>By Malay Bhavsar</p>
<br />
<p>It is a simple yet useful login system. You can use it with your software.</p>
<p>Follow the steps in the SQL shell given in the Setup. file</p>
<p>Only Fuctions are visible to the world and the data from the SQL is not visible even after printing it! (Secure)</p>
<p>Must have python and mysql installed</p>
<p>More to come yet! (Updates will be coming soon!)</p>
